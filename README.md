# DnD
Creating a Front-End with a Back-End website for people that would like to have their own D&D game, but without prior experience. E.g. newbies.

A work in progress at the moment.

# Currently thinking about the first Page. (08/12/2024) (22:50ðŸ•”)

E.g. how I'd want the people to start, to see the available options to choose from.
Basically the functionality of the website

# I thought about adding some maps
at the same time too, like where it would take place?

I'm thinking of later on adding a some sort of AI to ask questions depending on the situations & stuff. (Complex, i'm in my own thoughts currently)

# So I thought about it. (08/12/2024) (23:05ðŸ•¦)

I'll leave it be for now as it is.

# Fun fact: 
After a minute of thinking that I might be one exceptional person with this sort of idea, I've come to the realisation that other people already have these kinds of websites. Oh well, I might aswell make my own one.
