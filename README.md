# DnD
Creating a Front-End with a Back-End website for people that would like to have their own D&D game, but without prior experience. E.g. newbies.

A work in progress at the moment.

# Currently thinking about the first Page. (08/12/2024)

E.g. how I'd want the people to start, to see the available options to choose from.
Basically the functionality of the website
